# 👋 Hi — I'm Muhammed Kans (kans-devops)

I design systems that **stay online, scale under pressure, and recover fast**.  
Currently working as a DevOps Engineer — building automation, CI/CD, and reliable infrastructure.

---

## 🚀 What I deliver (for small teams & startups)
- **Clean CI/CD pipelines** (Jenkins → GitHub Actions) that run tests, build artifacts, and deploy safely.  
- **Containerization & deployments** — Docker images and reliable deployments to AWS EC2 / small K8s clusters.  
- **Infrastructure as Code** — maintainable Terraform + Ansible modules for repeatable environments.  
- **Monitoring & reliability** — Prometheus/Grafana basics to keep your apps visible and recoverable.

---

## 📂 Featured projects (will be public soon)
- **jenkins-ci-node-starter** — Jenkins pipeline → Docker image build (sample microservice app).  
- **gha-ci-node-starter** — GitHub Actions equivalent (CI for Node apps).  
- **aws-ec2-ansible-deploy** — Small Ansible playbook to deploy app on EC2 with Nginx.

Each repo has step-by-step README so you or your team can reproduce the setup in under an hour.
